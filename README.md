*This website is supposed to demonstrate how I feel about frogs.*

[my website!](http://symptomatic-ant.surge.sh/)

## What Worked Well
I had a lot of fun playing around with the CSS and making it look as chaotic as possible.
I was mimicking this website: https://flourbakery.com/ but instead of being able to buy baked goods, I made it so that the user can "buy" frogs.

## What Didn't
I really wanted to make the nav bar to stick but then I was unable to figure that out. 
I also wanted the color background to change while hovering over the options in the nav bar, but then I couldn't find out how to change the entire color of that specific section. (Not sure if this makes sense)

## EC
I made the logo and certain text on the website change its value when hovering. One of the backgrounds in the website has an animating background. The different options on the nav bar takes you the appropriate area (text area?) within the website when clicked. I also made the scroll bar a different color.
